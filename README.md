Very briefly we will go through everything.

2 . deploy.py is the game version which can be run locally  
3 . Press 's' to start the game and the next round  
4 . deploy2.py is the Flask app verion of the same  
5 . Here, the game starts automatically  
6 . In this game, the user will use thier fingers to play the game against the computer.  

For the flask version that is, deploy2.py,  you are welcome to make changes so that we can have a mechanism to control the start of the game and the next round.  
At the moment it is automatic
